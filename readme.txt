This program draws fractals using Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems). I wrote all of the classes except Turtle.java and
StdDraw.java, both of which I found online.

The program is really simple to use - just run any fractal class (meaning any of them besides Turtle, StdDraw, and
LSystem) and it will draw the fractal. You can mess around with the ITERATIONS field which each class has, which
controls how detailed you want the fractal to be. They are currently set at what I think is an optimal viewing
experience.

DISCLAIMER: I didn't invent any of the actual L-Systems; I just implemented them.

Enjoy!
